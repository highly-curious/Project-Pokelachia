# Pokémon Project Pokélachia
(working title)

This project is a custom Pokémon game based on [Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal/) which is based on [the Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal). Both projects are incredible, and their efforts have paved the way for new developers like our team to be able to begin our journey of Pokédevelopment. 

We are setting out to create a game set in an enitrely new region, based on the real world region of Appalachia. We are nearing completion on the Alpha phase of the game. 

Playable demo of the project coming soon!
